Product is light weight and comfortable to use. UI is user friendly. This phone is good for elderly persons who have minimal needs and don't do multitasking. All OTT platforms stream fine with high quality, colours and sound are good. Camera is okay. Charging adapter is not included in the package. We need to buy seperately. Original Samsung 25W charging adapter alone costs Rs.900 to Rs.1,000. Other brands 25W charging adapter costs around Rs.400 to Rs.600. Please do keep this in mind while buying the phone. Instead of buying new adapter I am using the old phones 10W charging adapter and cable (USB to Type-C) so far all good. If your budget is between Rs.6,000 to Rs.7,000 then this is very good choice.\n\nGiving 4 stars because charging adapter is not included.\n44 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nK venkat\nColour with asian paints app is not supporting\nReviewed in India on 22 September 2025\nVerified Purchase\nPhone is ok but\nNot supporting all apps\nIam facing the problem\nHelpful\nReport\nSwarnadip Barik\nUnder rs 6500 smartphone this device is worth it.\nReviewed in India on 25 September 2025\nVerified Purchase\nAccording to the price just buy it if you get this product in around 6500 otherwise go for other brands Interface feels laggy but you can watch youtube videos in 1440p(2k). And otherwise this device can support 25W fast charging. The time it takes (0 to 100%) around 1:30 min battery is good single speaker and the speaker quality is decent. Camara quality is not top notch but decent. It handle day to day task like phone calls taking pictures and chats (WhatsApp) etc this device can handle it properly. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR GAMING. Overall according to the price this is a great value for money product. I bought it in rs. 6249 (Great Indian Festival) so this phone is value for money for day to day user under 7000 rs smartphones.\nOne person found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nIgnatius Rodrigues\nValue for money\nReviewed in India on 23 September 2025\nVerified Purchase\nValue for money.

By the way they will tell you it's midrange, it's not. It's flagship at not so flagship price. It's not for heavy use as the battery is average. Average usage will last a day. The feel is premium. Processor is good for multi-tasking. Yes gamers might complain but please dont buy Samsung phone especially if all you want to do is gaming. Samsung is not for gaming, but for that smooth software experience, brand value and reliability. Camera is good. Online you might find mixed reviews as there are other phones offering better hardware and features at this price. At the end of the day software plays a huge part in user experience.\n36 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nShuvendu B.\nOverall review\nReviewed in India on 17 July 2025\nVerified Purchase\nIf you're looking for a flagship-like experience at a more affordable price, the S24 FE is a great choice. It offers solid performance, a beautiful display, and a reliable camera system â€” perfect for daily use, content creation, or casual gaming.\n9 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nManish\nA Complete Package - must buy\nReviewed in India on 27 July 2025\nVerified Purchase\nThis phone is huge which is very helpful for me for performing my all day to day work. The Display and the AI features of samsung has no competition. Great sound quality and haptics. Photos and videos come out very beautiful in bright conditions. Weighs and feels like a brick which is fine. Even though all other chinese brand at 35k feels a better option but this phone is a complete package which doesn't feel to be missing out on anything. Charging speed is fine(managable). The quality of phone is top notch - feels very premium. Gorilla glass victus feels like a cherry on the cake. I have all - samsung tab, buds and a laptop - the ecosystem is just crazy good, works butter smooth with each other. As I student I samsung notes helps me alot and I can access them whenever wherever on whichever device I want. For me it feels like freedom. I am very happy with this product and the economy.\n6 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nRahul Nair\nGo for it won't disappoint\nReviewed in India on 23 August 2025\nVerified Purchase\nBest in this range ,decent battery life wud easily last a day, on moderate usage , good camera for both day and night photography processesor is an Exynos that was something which kept me back from buying it but now that have using for a month it's good enough in the price range,and samsung really has the ace up the sleeve with one UI.\nOne person found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nDeepak\nDecent phone\nReviewed in India on 15 September 2025\nVerified Purchase\nDecent phone for daily use and as expected photo quality is top notch.\nSmall issue observed that touch is not working smoothly when phone is not in hand and kept on a table.\nOtherwise no issues observed.\n\n\n\n\n4 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nVivek\nBroad review of S24 FE\nReviewed in India on 5 June 2025\nVerified Purchase\nAmazing phone with all the S series flagship features. If you're looking for the premium features of samsung on a budget then this is the perfect phone.\nRegarding the heating issue it did get quite warm on the first bootup but after updating it to the latest version it's much better. The only time it heats is when you're using camera for a long time or doing some heavy gaming.\nBattery life is average I would say, not the best in the market but for a person with not much heavy usage it would last a day.\nVideo stabilization is one of the best you can get in this price range.\nAs of now no performance drops or lags it's quite what I expected to be after seeing all the reviews before buying this phone.\nWouldn't recommend this phone for intensive gamers as thermal throttling is there.\nOverall for 35k is definitely a value for money phone right now.\n31 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nRavikumar YV\nDecent phone\nReviewed in India on 1 September 2025\nVerified Purchase\nPhone is good.
