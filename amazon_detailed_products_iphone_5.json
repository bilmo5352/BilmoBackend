From the moment I unboxed it, the sleek design and soft pastel pink color caught my attention‚Äîit looks even better in person than in pictures. Phone is lightweight aluminum and glass build, making the phone feel premium yet comfortable to hold. The pink shade is elegant and subtle, perfect for anyone who loves a touch of sophistication. The 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display is bright, sharp, and offers vibrant colors. Whether watching videos or scrolling through social media, the experience is smooth and immersive. The 48MP main camera and 12MP ultra-wide lens take incredible photos, even in low light. The details, sharpness, and colors are truly impressive. Portrait mode works beautifully, capturing professional-looking shots effortlessly. The front camera is equally good for selfies and FaceTime. Charging with the USB-C port is much more convenient than before, and fast charging is a plus. The delivery was fast and secure, with the iPhone arriving in perfect condition. The packaging was intact, and setting up the phone was a breeze. If you're looking for a stylish, powerful, and reliable phone, the iPhone 15 in Pink is a fantastic choice.\n94 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nSahil Arora\n‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è Sleek, Fast & Reliable ‚Äì A Solid Upgrade\nReviewed in India on 26 May 2025\nColour: GreenSize: 128 GBVerified Purchase\nThe iPhone 15 is a noticeable step up from previous models.

The display is bright and clear, perfect for watching videos or browsing. If you're upgrading from an older iPhone, the iPhone 15 feels like a worthy investment. It‚Äôs reliable, fast, and beautifully designed.\n20 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nabhinav p.\nGood\nReviewed in India on 3 September 2025\nColour: BlackSize: 128 GBVerified Purchase\nAmazing phone\nOne person found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nSandy Cariappa\niPhone XR to iPhone 15\nReviewed in India on 7 October 2023\nColour: BlueSize: 128 GBVerified Purchase\nJust made the transition and here‚Äôs my POV on the first ~2 month of use\n\nPros\n- Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants\n- Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I‚Äôm transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here\n- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it‚Äôs spotless\n- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA\n- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome\n- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.\n- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone\n- Apples approach on Security!\n- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawless\n\nCons\n- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone‚Ä¶ including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up‚Ä¶.. works like a charm\n- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchases\n\nIndustry memes\n- USB C : honestly don‚Äôt give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It‚Äôs just a mode of charging for me and that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much\n- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!\n- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?\n- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I‚Äôve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for texting\n\nTips of managing battery health\n- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don‚Äôt need back ground refresh\n- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up\n- I charge my phone only using a power bank not direct wired or wireless charging\n- Don‚Äôt let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%\n- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service\n- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section\n- I don‚Äôt use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc\n- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I‚Äôm recommending above\n\nVendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once. The purchase experience is breezy and quick, thanks team for the support and look forward to the collaboration in the future.\n\n‚Ä¶.. watch out for this space. Will keep updating in case of significant change in experience\nRead more\n873 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nDivya Singh\nCamera\nReviewed in India on 11 September 2025\nVerified Purchase\nGood quality\n4 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nDharminder Singh\nExcellent Upgrade ‚Äì Sleek, Fast, and Worth It!\nReviewed in India on 11 August 2025\nColour: BlackSize: 128 GBVerified Purchase\n\"Sleek, superfast & stunning! üì±‚ú®\nGot my iPhone 15 from Amazon ‚Äì quick delivery, perfect packaging.
