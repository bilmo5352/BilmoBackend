No heating issue. Battery lasts around 3.5-4 hours with basic tasks. Display is decent. Lightweight and easy to carry around. The body quality is good too. Overall a good buy for the price. My previous acer laptop is over 12 years old i7 and still running fine.

Ruining my image of shop.\nReviewed in India on 9 September 2025\nStyle Name: Aspire Lite R5 16GB/1TB SSDVerified Purchase\nDon't but this Laptop.\nI did not notice it in the 1st year as usage was not much but in the 2nd year when I started to use it daily, it creates problem. It doesn't get connected to printers and outside service usb's on many occasions and then when I restart it takes 15-20 minutes and then shows error message and then starts. When I force restart it does start and works and gets connected but later after some similar attempts it locked me out and then asked to keep it on for 2 hours due to many restart attempts. I am out of warranty now and can't do anything as it will cost me too much for service. Ruined my image in front of customers who comes for print or photo copies, as I have to force restart every alternate time. Worst experience with this company. Never ever buying anything from it. Go for HP or other good brands.\n\n\n\n27 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nShubham Sahu\nAcer is too much GOOD üëç\nReviewed in India on 24 July 2025\nStyle Name: 16GB/512GBVerified Purchase\nVery good quality and Completely worth for money AMD Ryzen 5 working very smoothly and 16GB/512GB makes it versatile for every function and Build quality is so awesome.

I felt this is a very good laptop for this price range. I changed OS to Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Linux). Ubuntu is working well in this laptop. Very smooth and fast. I felt a premium feel on this laptop. It is built using metal body. Proper weight and 15.6 inch size.\n\nSound quality, microphone quality and camera quality is average. But I think this is very common in this price range.\n\nI initially faced a problem after booting Ubuntu is we can't control the backlit keyboard. But I changed a line in GRUB file now I can change the colors, toggle, decrease/increase the brightness of the keyboard backlit using Fn key.\n\nBluetooth is not working in this laptop in Linux. I bought a dongle and plugged, now it is working well.\n\nAnyways, I am 100% satisfied with this product.\n19 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nSee more reviews",
