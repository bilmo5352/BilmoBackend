Detailed review.\nReviewed in India on 27 July 2025\nColour: MOONLIGHT WHITEVerified Purchase\nIts been one week and i like it. Good design of the earbuds(not the charging case). Perfectly fit in my ears. Good sound. But when i use google assistant, the voice breaks and it goes dim. Thats the only problem. Fuctioning is also good. Easy connect. Charging speed is overall good. I was able to use it for 5 hour straight with full charge. After 5 hours, the charge was 30%. Overall good one. Although, i suggest that they should change the design of the charging case and make it look a bit more cooler. The current shape of the charging case is so simple and not cool at all. Anyway, I recommend it...\n\n\n7 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nRanjit\nBest TWS at 1000\nReviewed in India on 25 September 2025\nColour: Volt BlackVerified Purchase\nBest product under 1000.....connect to Bluetooth with blink of eye.....batter backup is of 2 days in normal usase....don't not come with charging cable....if you want to buy go on....I got one day delivery within great Indian festival sale\n\n\nHelpful\nReport\nJaikumar Gaja\nGreat Value for the Price\nReviewed in India on 24 July 2025\nColour: Volt BlackVerified Purchase\nPrice Paid: ₹1099 – An excellent deal for what these earbuds offer.\n\nComfort: Very comfortable to wear, even for long hours. I’ve used them for extended periods without any ear fatigue.\n\nSound Quality: The sound is surprisingly good for this price range. It comes set to the “Clear Bass” mode by default, but you can change it in the Realme Link app to “Vocals,” “Original,” or “Deep Bass” depending on your preference. Highly recommend using the app—it really enhances the experience.\n\nBattery Life: Battery performance is solid. I’m a light to moderate user, and it’s been 4 days since I last charged the case. As of now, it still has 30% battery left, which is impressive.\n\nFit: At first, it feels like the earbuds might fall out, but the design ensures a secure fit. The stem helps keep them snugly in place, even during light movement.\n\nWeight: Extremely lightweight—so much so that I barely feel them when worn. Very comfortable for all-day use.\n\nConnectivity: These earbuds support Google Fast Pair, and it works flawlessly. As soon as I open the case, the earbuds connect instantly to my phone. There’s no noticeable lag or delay—very seamless experience.\n\nApp & Updates: The Realme Link app is a must-have for these earbuds. Not only does it let you customize sound modes, but it also has a firmware update available that improves overall performance.\n\nTouch Controls: The touch sensor works very well. What I really like is that it gives soft feedback sounds when you interact—like “beep beep” for a double tap and “beep beep beep” for a triple tap. This makes it easy to know your touch was registered, which is a nice touch.\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nSrinath\nAverage product\nReviewed in India on 12 August 2025\nColour: Volt BlackVerified Purchase\nAfter using it for more than 45 minutes my ears starts to pain, comfort level is average than the other ear pods available in the market.\n\nSound quality is good and in the Link application we can change the bass setting.\n\nIn deep bass only the sound quality is good.\n\nThe build quality is good at this price range.\n\nAbout the functionality, the pairing is not up to the level.

The earbuds provide a tight, secure fit in the ears, and customers consider them worth the price. The functionality and connectivity receive mixed reviews - while the ANC works well and Bluetooth connection is fast and stable, some report issues with right earbuds not working properly and dual device connection problems. Battery life is also mixed, with some praising the backup while others find it poor.\nGenerated from the text of customer reviews\nSelect to learn more\nSound quality\nQuality\nValue for money\nNoise cancellation\nFit\nBattery life\nFunctionality\nConnectivity\n\nReviews with images\nSee all photos\nTop reviews from India\nJOY NATH\nImpressive Quality and Superb Sound\nReviewed in India on 16 September 2025\nStyle Name: Buds N1Colour: Energizing GreenVerified Purchase\nI started using the Realme N1 46dB Hybrid ANC Buds, and honestly, I’m super impressed. These earbuds offer a sleek and modern design with excellent build quality. The biggest highlight is the Hybrid Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) feature, which effectively reduces surrounding noise by up to 46dB, making it perfect for noisy places like metros, streets, or crowded offices.\n\n🔊 Sound Quality: The sound output is crisp, balanced, and very immersive. The bass is punchy without overpowering the mids and highs, making it great for all kinds of music, podcasts, or calls.\n\n🔋 Battery Life: Impressive! Once fully charged, you can easily enjoy long playback hours without worrying about running out of power.\n\n📱 Connectivity: The Bluetooth 5.3 connection is very stable, providing a lag-free experience. I didn’t experience any random disconnects or interference.\n\n🎧 Comfort & Design: Lightweight and ergonomic, these buds fit well in the ears, and you can wear them for hours without discomfort.\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nAnkit Das\nRealme buds n1 unboxing review\nReviewed in India on 10 August 2025\nStyle Name: Buds N1Colour: Energizing GreenVerified Purchase\nAudio good 👍 ,infact one of the best sounding tws till now I have used coming from OnePlus nord buds 2 and newer nord buds 3 anc is excellent and other features are extremely good using a realme smartphone with this , experience is good for price but the one place where it felt cheap is the finish it use glossy plastic finish which attracts scratches from day 0 so I suggest either use a case or be ready for the scratches, also battery is ok not good not bad.\n\n\n7 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nAman Kumar\nReliable budget tws\nReviewed in India on 18 August 2025\nStyle Name: Buds N1Colour: Energizing GreenVerified Purchase\nI got this set while I was quite skeptical about it. But the product is actually a real bang for the buck. For anyone wondering this is just a rebranded version of the T310 and that means all the features are literally the same. The connection is rock-solid(I tried to leave out my device inside my room and closed all doors and windows. Then I went to my terrace so there is less possibilities for the signals to bounce around and it maintained a stable connection without any jitters or distortion. Although using with my laptop does cause minor hiccups during transition to another song but it just might be my application causing.) It supports swift pair and you get a prompt to connect it with your smartphone almost instantly as soon as you open the lids. In app controls are exactly the same as for T310. Thee only difference seems to be that it will show under the name of N1 which is to be expected. Although it has not been inexplicable mentioned if it has 45ms latency but the app does feature a low latency mode. Spatial audio actually works and makes the audio richer and gives its more volume. The eq modes are well balanced although personal fine tuning will give you the best performance. There is an option to further enhance your listening experience by tinkering with the dynamic audio option. For me it is a complete package at a reasonable price and I quite like realme's sound signature so these are good. Touch controls are responsive. The case itself has good hinges and feels solid but the glossy finish is destined to get scratches so don't consider it if you care about aesthetics. The battery life on the other hand is something which seems to be one of its cons. It will last you a good while when used without ANC but on a full charge and at around 50-60% volume with dual connection and ANC it lasts for about 4 hours. Overall a great reliable pair of earbuds which have good bass and balanced sound, stable connection, and good features for the price range.\nRead more\n8 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nAnkush\nVery Very Satisfactory\nReviewed in India on 23 September 2025\nStyle Name: Buds T310Colour: Vibrant BlackVerified Purchase\nBass is good in noise cancellation for heavy metal bass\nMid or high is very crispy\nIn 1700 rs price its a steal deal\nMy opinion Charging cable is Must.

Excellent sound quality and battery life, spatial audio and active noise cancelling. They also pair fast by Bluetooth. The catch is that to enable spatial audio, you have to download the RealMe Link app and set your country of origin to India or China to get the spatial audio feature to show up in the app. Other than that, excellent earbuds to use with a Dolby Atmos supported smartphone\nReport\nAxel\nMuy buenos\nReviewed in the United States on 31 March 2025\nStyle Name: Buds T310Colour: Agile WhiteVerified Purchase\nMuy buenos.
