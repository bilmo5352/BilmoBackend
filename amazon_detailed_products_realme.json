The AMOLED display is vibrant, the 6000mAh battery lasts long, and 80W charging is fast. The camera performs well, though it lacks an ultra-wide lens. Performance is smooth for daily use, but it can heat up a bit during heavy tasks. Overall, it's a stylish and value-for-money device.\n25 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nNivedita Chatterjee\nThumbs up\nReviewed in India on 17 September 2025\nColour: Crystal PurpleSize: 6+128Verified Purchase\nGood functionalities under such reasonable price.

It takes longer time to fully charge the phone. Now days fast charging adapter is given with the phone. Also photos clicked from the camera are not so good or outstanding. Overall the phone performance is good but not outstanding. Good for entry level or who want low budget phones.\n7 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nBD\nGreat Budget Phone\nReviewed in India on 26 August 2025\nColour: Crystal PurpleSize: 6+128Verified Purchase\nToday completed a little more than 1 month of usage for this phone . The phone hangs although rarely . App opening is relatively fast . RAM management is ok not very good . Also rarely phone heats up when charging although heating is not much . Battery backup is great . For battery health reason , I chose the charging setting to 80% . With 80 percent I get almost 10 hrs 30 mins of continuous usage using YouTube Facebook browsing mostly and ofcourse calls . I think the battery consumption is less in wifi than sim card internet . Call quality is good , speaker has inbuilt 300% which is good for me . Catching wifi signal is not good not bad in in those places where wifi signal is low. Screen quality is ok for me after turning on eye protection , for many it may not be exciting . Camera picture and video quality is descent for a budget phone like this . For better picture video quality I use gcam which uses the phone s picture video capability in a better way . Over all no complain so far . I got this phone for 8990 /- after exchanging my previous realme narzo 21 A for 5 yrs .\n35 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nKindle Customer\nGood phone\nReviewed in India on 2 September 2025\nColour: Crystal PurpleSize: 6+128Verified Purchase\nPhone quality is good only working is bit slow but overall good performance in this range\n3 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nRajesh\nA good budget phone\nReviewed in India on 8 September 2025\nColour: Crystal PurpleSize: 6+128Verified Purchase\nGood product in budgetable segment , weight is light, display quality is better in this price, camera is decent.
