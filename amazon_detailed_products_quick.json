Earlier I had Kaspersky Total Security but that was an aggressive product, kind of truly blocked every website in a particular category. So after reading reviews I decided to pay more than double for the 3 years license and go for Quick Heal. Everything was okay until I decided to run some basic tests on kids safety i.e. access unsafe content. To my surprise all graphic and explicit content was getting downloaded. Even image search with word 'nude' returned tons of porn images. On one hand it did not provide any protection from unsafe sites and other hand blocked WebEx and file access on Microsoft teams. I raised tech support tickets. The response from the QuickHeal team was fast but thennwhat they told me I was shocked. QuickHeal does not provide keyword or content based filtering. So if a website is not yet categorised in thier catalogue it would pass through and you would have to manually add URLs to the block list. Are you guys serious? You expect people to manually block millions of adult and unsafe sites. Is this what QuickHeal claims parental control and kids safety !! Google safe search provides better filtering than this. I hardly used this for 2 days and uninstalled it as does not do what it says it should do. As I write this feedback I am still in contact with the QuickHeal product team as I want them to be transparent on how they advertise and what they offer. Quick heal Total Security is a simple antivirus product + firewall + some fancy features. Parents looking for a product to safeguard their kids computer, I strongly suggest better go for other products. They offer better protection and cheaper too. I have switched back to Kaspersky and happy with my decision. Finally if at all you decide to go for Quick Heal do not buy from TechEzy - Amazon Marketplace. Worst people to do business with. They don't even have courtesy to respond to emails. Finally thanks to Amazon to help me resolve my concerns.\nRead more\n16 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nAmita Choudhary\nGood\nReviewed in India on 5 August 2025\nVerified Purchase\nIt's good\nHelpful\nReport\nSee more reviews",
