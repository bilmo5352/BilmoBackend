# ✅ Flipkart Image Extraction - Complete Fix

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Issue**: Flipkart scraper was extracting Flipkart logos instead of actual product images.

**Solution**: Added smart image filtering to skip UI elements and prefer product images.

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. **Ultra Aggressive Image Search**
Searches in 4 levels:
- Link element itself
- Parent element
- Grandparent element
- Section element

### 2. **Multiple Image Attributes**
Checks:
- `src`
- `data-src`
- `data-lazy`
- `data-original`
- `data-url`
- `srcset`

### 3. **Smart Filtering (NEW)**

#### Skip These Patterns:
```python
skip_patterns = [
    'fkheaderlogo',         # Flipkart logo
    'logo',                 # Any logo
    'header',               # Header images
    'banner',               # Banner images
    'sprite',               # UI sprites
    'icon',                 # Icons
    'exploreplus',          # Flipkart Plus logo
    'fk-p-flap/1620',       # Banner size
    'fk-p-flap/530',        # Banner size
    'fk-p-flap/520',        # Banner size
    'batman-returns/batman-returns/p/images'  # UI images
]
```

#### Prefer Product Images:
```python
# Prioritize images from:
- 'rukminim' domain (Flipkart product CDN)
- 'flixcart.com/image'
- URLs with '/image/' in path
```

## 📊 Before vs After

### **Before:**
```json
{
  "title": "iPhone 17 Pro",
  "image": "https://static-assets-web.flixcart.com/.../fkheaderlogo.svg",  ❌ Logo!
  "price": "₹17,999"
}
```

### **After:**
```json
{
  "title": "iPhone 17 Pro",
  "image": "https://rukminim2.flixcart.com/.../product-image.jpg",  ✅ Product!
  "price": "₹17,999"
}
```

---

## 🎯 Image Selection Priority

1. **Product images** from `rukminim` CDN (highest priority)
2. **Product images** with `/image/` in path
3. **Any image** that's not a logo/banner (fallback)
4. **No image** if only logos found (better than wrong image)

---

## ✅ Test Results
