You get a option for turbo charging to get rid of this .\nSpeaker quality is not good . Sound is not clear and loud .\nBut still it's a good option under 12k . Don't expect high quality in low budget phones .\n17 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nAjay Rathore\nGood phone but Amazon experience was a HUGE let down\nReviewed in India on 30 September 2024\nColour: Hawaiian BlueSize: 8+128Verified Purchase\nThe product is good. Haven't used it much to share how it works but so far so good. The package was well cushioned and the delivery was impeccable. The delivery executive was polite and professional.\n\nWhile buying the phone, I chose to exchange my old Xiaomi Note 8 (5 year old) and the site showed the exchange value as 3800 (199 exchange charge extra). When the phone was assessed at the spot, owing to a small dent on the side, the exchange value was knocked down by 60%!! Mind you, the screen had no scratches or dead pixels, both front and back glass was intact, the phone was working but my, oh my.\n\nThis is pure mis-selling since they need to phone to be ABSOLUTELY new to give you just 40% of the buy price.\n\nUpdate 1: Been using the phone for a few days and there are a few hits and misses.\n\nHits:\nThe resolution is good\nNo heating issues with the battery\nBattery life is good\nCharge time is good\n\nMisses:\nDespite a 120Hz refresh rate, the screen is laggy and sticks (video attached)\nThe touch is sticky and results in unexpected lags/pinches\nDespite pocket mode activated, the phone screen comes on resulting in unexpected button presses\nA few apps like Amazon, Phonepe take a while to load, unlock\nThe camera is average with washed out colours\n\nWill add more later.\n\nUpdate 2: Touch issues are really bad with double tap, mis-tap happening one too many times. Another issue I noticed was that the ringtone can’t be changed. Looks more like a software glitch.\nRead more\n186 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nRobbince Pathak\nProduct is awesome but delivery service very bad\nReviewed in India on 16 August 2025\nColour: Diaomond BlackSize: 8+128Verified Purchase\nProduct is awesome. Bought it on exchange. Providing many features comparatively to others at this price. But I am much annoyed with the delivery boy. He attempted to deliver once that too called me 2 kms away from the given address. Thereafter during next 3 days no-one delivered and number was also blocked by that delivery boy. Desperately I tried to connect with the customer care but they attended the call and told to wait for 2 mins and that 2 mins did not end in 10 mins. Customer care is also not responsive. Now I don't recommend Amazon. I felt that the delivery service of flipkart is best.\n6 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nSaxena Enterprise\nGood deal with such low budget....\nReviewed in India on 17 September 2025\nColour: Diaomond BlackSize: 8+128Verified Purchase\nTill now for a year,..it did't hang.....and works smoothly....still....looks new....as i have safe cover it....instead of just normal cover...full cover ..is good ..for such good phone.\n3 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nSrinivas Raj Kanamaluru\nRedmi 13G Battery Issues\nReviewed in India on 4 September 2025\nColour: Diaomond BlackSize: 8+128Verified Purchase\nBattery is not upto what was expected.

The claim that the camera quality is 50 megapixels is FAR from the truth. To test it, I compared it with Realme C12, a 7-year-old 13-megapixel phone. Except for the color grading of the pixel, nothing really has changed! There is NO benefit of any resolution here. It is pretty clear that the 50-megapixel reported camera value by the company doesn't correspond to the actual hardware.\n\n2. The battery and charging are the BIGGEST downside of the phone! The claim that the battery has around 5000+ mAh doesn't seem to be true. It is FAR inferior to my Realme C12 which reports 6000+ mAh battery. Charging doesn't work when the phone is switched on with a portable hotspot, data and GPS are on! So once switched off, the charging works well corresponding to a fast charger up to 90% of the battery charge status, after which it slows down and gets severely struck at 95% charging status. The last 5% take more than 15-20 mins!\n\n3. Sound Quality is pretty normal and ordinary compared to any other phone.\n\n4. The phone actually weighs more and is not as portable as my old 7.5k Realme C12. The camera design is pretty lame and has no performance benefit over Realme C12 in comparison. The circular extension at the back actually makes it difficult to hold a bit. The cameras are far more ordinary with just better color grading.\n\n5. It doesn't support Airtel 5G as Manufacturers admit.\n\n6. The memory capacity RAM is 4G, which is 1G improvement over Realme C12. But for an ordinary user with 4-5 years of use, this shouldn't affect him much, unless gaming or other performance extensive use.\nRead more\n36 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nVipul Srivastava\nLooks are Killer\nReviewed in India on 26 September 2025\nColour: Starry BlackSize: 6GB+128GBVerified Purchase\nAwesome looks\nWorthy price\nFeatures are good\nPerformance will use for the month and then update review accordingly\nHelpful\nReport\nbrahmaji\nమొత్తానికి అంత హ్యాపీ గుడ్ 👍\nReviewed in India on 25 September 2025\nColour: Sparkle PurpleSize: 6GB+128GBVerified Purchase\nఇది నాకోసం ఆర్డర్ చేయలేదు మా అంకుల్ కి వేరే ఊరిలో ఉంటారు అక్కడకు నేను 70km దూరంలో ఉండి ఆర్డర్ పెట్టాను, వాళ్ళు ఫోన్ పాకింగ్ అంతా బాగుంది అని చెప్పారు good\nHelpful\nReport\nTranslate review to English\nImran Shaha Ayub Shaha\nBest For Normal use\nReviewed in India on 24 September 2025\nColour: Starry BlackSize: 6GB+128GBVerified Purchase\nAverage phone..\n\nBest for normal use...\nOne person found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nSee more reviews\nTop reviews from other countries\nNOUFAL LK\nExcellent\nReviewed in the United Arab Emirates on 3 April 2025\nColour: Sparkle PurpleSize: 4GB+128GBVerified Purchase\nExcellent Product!

Additionally, the battery life and 5G connectivity show mixed results, with some praising the battery backup while others complain about fast drain, and while Jio 5G support is flawless, Airtel 5G services don't work with the device.\nGenerated from the text of customer reviews\nSelect to learn more\nPhone quality\nValue for money\nCamera quality\nBattery life\n5g connectivity\nPerformance\nDisplay quality\nFunctionality\n\nReviews with images\nSee all photos\nTop reviews from India\nTranslate all reviews to English\nbudgt friendly but no battary backup more than 1 hour\nits cost effective\nReviewed in India on 25 September 2025\nColour: Starry BlackSize: 6GB+128GBVerified Purchase\nVERY NICE PRODUCT IN THIS PRICE GOOD CHOICE\nHelpful\nReport\nBablu\nGood 5G Smart Phone.\nReviewed in India on 17 July 2025\nColour: Sparkle PurpleSize: 4GB+64GBVerified Purchase\nPerformance : Mi A4 5G\n100% Jio 5G Smartphone.\n4gb Ram + 64gb Rom.\n33 Watt Mobile Charger.\nDeliver & Parking Good.\nBattey life is good.\nDisplay is Good.\nPhone no hangs.\nFront camera Quality is bad but back camera quality is good.\nPay heed: Yah Smartphone Jio 5G Ko Support Karta Hai, Is Phone Me Jio Ki Sim First Floor me Add Karane par hi 5G Support karegi.\nAll is Well.\nThanks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nSadia Afrin\nSadia\nReviewed in India on 26 September 2025\nColour: Sparkle PurpleSize: 4GB+64GBVerified Purchase\nPhone quality looks good according to price this price just close your eyes and go for it\nHelpful\nReport\nSunil Kumar Giri\nGood product in cheapest price\nReviewed in India on 15 September 2025\nColour: Starry BlackSize: 4GB+64GBVerified Purchase\nGood quality with good value of money\n5 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nAbhas Kumar Sinha\nCamera and Battery warning!\nReviewed in India on 18 February 2025\nColour: Starry BlackSize: 4GB+64GBVerified Purchase\n1. The claim that the camera quality is 50 megapixels is FAR from the truth. To test it, I compared it with Realme C12, a 7-year-old 13-megapixel phone. Except for the color grading of the pixel, nothing really has changed! There is NO benefit of any resolution here. It is pretty clear that the 50-megapixel reported camera value by the company doesn't correspond to the actual hardware.\n\n2. The battery and charging are the BIGGEST downside of the phone! The claim that the battery has around 5000+ mAh doesn't seem to be true. It is FAR inferior to my Realme C12 which reports 6000+ mAh battery. Charging doesn't work when the phone is switched on with a portable hotspot, data and GPS are on! So once switched off, the charging works well corresponding to a fast charger up to 90% of the battery charge status, after which it slows down and gets severely struck at 95% charging status. The last 5% take more than 15-20 mins!\n\n3. Sound Quality is pretty normal and ordinary compared to any other phone.\n\n4. The phone actually weighs more and is not as portable as my old 7.5k Realme C12. The camera design is pretty lame and has no performance benefit over Realme C12 in comparison. The circular extension at the back actually makes it difficult to hold a bit. The cameras are far more ordinary with just better color grading.\n\n5. It doesn't support Airtel 5G as Manufacturers admit.\n\n6. The memory capacity RAM is 4G, which is 1G improvement over Realme C12. But for an ordinary user with 4-5 years of use, this shouldn't affect him much, unless gaming or other performance extensive use.\nRead more\n36 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nVipul Srivastava\nLooks are Killer\nReviewed in India on 26 September 2025\nColour: Starry BlackSize: 6GB+128GBVerified Purchase\nAwesome looks\nWorthy price\nFeatures are good\nPerformance will use for the month and then update review accordingly\nHelpful\nReport\nbrahmaji\nమొత్తానికి అంత హ్యాపీ గుడ్ 👍\nReviewed in India on 25 September 2025\nColour: Sparkle PurpleSize: 6GB+128GBVerified Purchase\nఇది నాకోసం ఆర్డర్ చేయలేదు మా అంకుల్ కి వేరే ఊరిలో ఉంటారు అక్కడకు నేను 70km దూరంలో ఉండి ఆర్డర్ పెట్టాను, వాళ్ళు ఫోన్ పాకింగ్ అంతా బాగుంది అని చెప్పారు good\nHelpful\nReport\nTranslate review to English\nImran Shaha Ayub Shaha\nBest For Normal use\nReviewed in India on 24 September 2025\nColour: Starry BlackSize: 6GB+128GBVerified Purchase\nAverage phone..\n\nBest for normal use...\nOne person found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nSee more reviews\nTop reviews from other countries\nNOUFAL LK\nExcellent\nReviewed in the United Arab Emirates on 3 April 2025\nColour: Sparkle PurpleSize: 4GB+128GBVerified Purchase\nExcellent Product!
